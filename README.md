Welcome to our project:)

The project allows you to do arithmetic operations on mathematical functions such as:Polynom,Monom and complex function. In addition the project allows you to do arithmetic operations such as:plus, minus, multipy, divide function composition and And drawing a graph of functions in an axis system.

The project represent a 4 main classes :

Monom: This class create Monom form of "ax^b" and performs arithmetic operations on it.

Polynom: This class create list of Monoms and performs arithmetic operations on it. 

ComplexFunction: This class create function that contains two function(Monom/Polynom/complex function) and arithmetic operations on it.

Function_GUI: This class contains collection of function,this class can write a file and read from it and also can draw a graph of the function collection.
